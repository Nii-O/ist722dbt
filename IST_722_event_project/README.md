IST 722 is a Data Warehousing class that introduces students to the basics of creating a data warehouse.
Using an events management database created in a previous project, we developed about six dimensions from the database which we later combined into fact tables.
The database was created in snowflake which was later connected to DBT Cloud (Data Build Tool) where the next steps of dimension and fact table creation was done.
